1 October 2008 (version 0.12)
	fixed lc3convert issues with unterminated (Windows-style) last 
		line in input file (both binary and hex); added multiple 
		hex values error as part of changes
	fixed lc3sim-tk self-deadlock issues with some versions of wish 
		through bindings on window Destroy events by removing 
		such bindings before exiting; problem showed up primarily 
		as hangs when the "Quit" button was pressed; this bug
		had been around for quite a while, but I didn't understand
		why until about Feb 2008

22 October 2005
	moved lc3_register declaration and macro into lc3sim.c (eliminated
		duplicate/mis-matched declaration in lc3sim.h) 

9 February 2005 (version 0.11)
	made lc3as accept \" for quote marks as part of strings
	changed both lc3as and lc3convert to reject values above
		0x10000 as invalid rather than mapping them silently
		into 16-bit values
	changed lc3convert hex mode to work with both with and without
		preceding 'x'
	changed lc3as and lc3convert read value routines to work with
		compilers for 64-bit ISAs (i.e., those for which long
		gives a 64-bit number)

10 March 2004
	fixed minor bug in dump_memory to handle full memory dump
		(all 65,536 addresses)
	fixed similar bug in disassemble

4 March 2004 (version 0.10)
	changed lc3as lexer to accept multi-line strings
	fixed lexer bug with handling bad operands after opcodes
	allowed negative numbers (and labels) to be used in simulator
	made error message for illegal instruction visible in GUI
	added "finish" command and button in GUI
	added keyboard shortcut 'f' for finish command in GUI
	cleared stop message after printing once (was left on before)

3 March 2004
	checked lc3in rather than descriptor 0 for terminal nature
		when starting execution of LC-3 instructions
	added option to flush input from terminal when LC-3 stops to 
		avoid interpreting input typed to LC-3 as commands to 
		simulator
	rewrote GUI options management, cleaning up some odd behavioral
		aspects; still some oddity left, though, such as
		need to close color selection window before quitting

2 March 2004
	used separate fdopen calls to create unidirectional FILE*
		structures from the LC-3 console socket to the GUI
		front end; using a single call led to odd behavior
		with Solaris, and is potentially incompatible with
		SysV semantics
	improved error messages in cases where lc3os code or symbols 
		are not found
	initialized PC to x0000 and PSR to condition ZERO when
		starting/resetting machine (becomes visible if OS 
		code not available)
	added lc3os.sym to lc3sim Makefile default target list
	finished machine reset command implementation (started yesterday)
	made file command change file to be loaded when machine is reset
	added reset command to help
	added reset button to GUI
	added missing widget appearance controls (based on selected options)
	made code scrollbar not extend past bottom of code window

1 March 2004
	changed extension check on file load to add extension when
		either '.' does not appear, or '/' appears after the
		last '.' in the filename
	changed load message to read ".obj" instead of ".sym"
	fixed option command response message for stdin option
	checked for .END directive in assembler; added error messages
		for various combinations of missing .ORIG and .END
		directives
	added warning for text after .END directive

17 February 2004
	changed to use valid quit command to close simulator from lc3sim-tk
		(was using 'q' before, but had disallowed that abbreviation)

12 February 2004 (version 0.9)
	fixed processing of hex input without leading "x" in lc3convert
	eliminated warnings for use of strlen as field width when
		disassembling instructions; strlen returns size_t on
		some systems
	cleared system breakpoint when simulator stops for any reason
		other than being interrupted by GUI, thus fixing bugs
		with breakpoint associated with the "next" command 
		surviving HALTs, user breakpoints, etc.

10 February 2004 (version 0.8)
	added missing quotes to MacOS-X Fink font overrides
	eliminated system breakpoints in favor of single address associated 
		with "next" command, thereby eliminating a couple of bugs: 
		(1) if the simulator was interrupted through interaction 
		with the GUI, such as setting/clearing breakpoints, during 
		a "next" operation, it lost track of where it was supposed 
		to stop; and
		(2) if the "clear all breakpoints" command was issued,
		the system breakpoint was erased (this bug was shadowed
		by the first)
	made the next and step commands correctly dump state after
		execution; delayed memory updates were not handled
		correctly for these commands
	made "Apply" button in options window pull font point size values
		from entry boxes before application of new options; the
		sizes were previously reset unless <Return> had been pressed
		in the entry box
	changed default code font for MacOS-X Fink installation to
		{LucidaTypewriter 11 normal}

9 February 2004 (version 0.7)
	set execution permission on lc3sim-tk during make
	allowed omission of "x" prefix when converting hexadecimal files
		with lc3convert
	fixed problems with CR-LF sequences in lc3as and lc3convert;
		both should now work (and were tested) with DOS-style
		end of line sequences
	added overrides for default fonts when installing for MacOS-X
		with Fink project's version of Tcl/Tk; new fonts
		suggested by Tevis Money, who also provided information
		on necessary paths, etc.

29 January 2004
	started to add support for MacOS, but found that two possible
		flavors exist (Fink and Aqua).  Fink needs some path
		additions and possibly default font changes, whereas
		Aqua apparently works with 0.6, and is available from 
		www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_open_source/tcltkaqua.html

22 January 2004 (version 0.6)
	fixed a minor bug involving use of scan command functionality
		not available with Tk8.2 (but available with 8.3), thus
		preventing use with older versions of wish

18 December 2003 (version 0.5)
	(just comments by SSL today)
	I've heard no bug reports on Linux to date (2-3 installations?)
	I don't think that GUI works properly on Solaris, but I haven't
		had time to do a serious testing job at work yet.
	I use Cygwin at home, so it should be reasonably stable 
		(assuming that they don't insert bugs or expose any of mine)
	so...I guess I'm going to release more broadly, but I'll keep the
		0.5 as a warning for now
	(send bug reports to lumetta@uiuc.edu with something clear in the
		subject line)

12 November 2003
	added code to change BR to BRnzp in assembler
	allowed colons after labels, in the style used in some examples
		in the second edition of Patt and Patel; the colon form
		also allows the opcode and pseudo-op names to be used
		as labels (provided that they are followed by a colon
		when defined)

31 October 2003 (version 0.4)
	fixed off-by-one error in scanf limits in simulator
	fixed misunderstood argument in tcsetattr calls
	set VMIN and VTIME appropriately (1 and 0, resp.) when LC-3 runs
	finished writing and included new lc3convert tool for conversion 
		from .bin and .hex files to .obj files

30 October 2003
	started development of lc3convert tool by paring down copy of lc3as
		lexer

29 October 2003 (version 0.3)
	removed remaining dependencies on gmake (use of $@ and $<)
	added delay watch cursor use when opening options window
		(since it can take a long time when many fonts are
		available)
	added delay watch when starting up (takes a long time to
		fill 64k lines on some older machines)
	fixed ^C handling for Solaris
	fixed bugs with use of readline (in both Makefile and lc3sim.c)

21 October 2003
	added option to read LC-3 console input from stdin (or GUI
		console) during script execution; turned ON by default

19 October 2003 (version 0.2: fixed some bugs, large and small)
	re-disassembled code for GUI after writing memory
	created option to delay updated code to GUI until LC-3 stops
		(on by default)
	added support to GUI to change delay option
	fixed retagging PC and breakpoints when values change
	made simulator indicate breakpoints and presence of PC in
		disassembly; simulator also indicates breakpoints now
	added display of '\a', '\b', and a few others
	fixed display of '{' and '}' (Tcl can't parse braces as lists)
	removed symbols from region of memory into which new code is loaded
		in simulator
	disallowed duplicate labels in assembler
	KNOWN ISSUE: may want to translate \a, \b, etc. when sent to console
		(console doesn't act like a VT-100)

18 October 2003 (version 0.1)
	software packaged for release to Austin
